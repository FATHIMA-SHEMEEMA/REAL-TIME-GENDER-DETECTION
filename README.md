# REAL-TIME-GENDER-DETECTION
Gender detection is one of the popular computer vision applications.  When you use a camera to detect a person’s gender instead of detecting it on a picture,  it can be said to be a real-time gender detection system.   To create a gender detection system using Python, we need to train a model with some high-level features of the face of human beings such as:  the distance between eyes, nose, and mouth  and measurements of different parts of the face of both the genders. There are many libraries and frameworks in Python that can be used to create a real-time gender detection system.  Some of these libraries include Yolo, Tensorflow, OpenCV, and Cvlib. So here I am going to use the Cvlib library in Python that can be used to detect the gender of a person.Along with Cvlib, I will also be using the OpenCV library in Python so that we can detect a person’s gender using a webcam. Once the above code starts executing, it will open your webcam and detect your gender as shown below. If you want to stop this program from running, just press “s” and it will stop your program from running.
